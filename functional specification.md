### Scope of the project

This project was presented and proposed by HARFANG 3D, a French company working in the software development sector, created in 2016 and founded by Philippe HERBER.
HARFANG 3D have already several projects to their credit such as "Poppy Ergo Jr Digital Twin" which is a robotic arm and controllable by an application, or "DOGFIGHT SANDBOX" which is a virtual reality application, to pilot planes also used by Turkish and Chinese universities to train drones. 

The product he asked us to work on is "FABGen" which is a binding generator running in Python, and which is already compatible with C++, Lua & Go. This product allows to translate the language to another one to avoid the users to have to know all the languages, our goal is to add a compatibility in Rust.
The computer languages are constantly developing and not all users have the time to learn them all, that's why with "FABGen", we are able to offer you the possibility to do more things without learn all languages. 

## Functional Requirements 

#### Assumptions and Constraints 
Assumptions are future situations, beyond the control of the project, whose outcomes influence the success of a project.  Constraints are limitations on the project that are beyond the control of the project team.  The following assumptions and constraints apply to this project

#### Assumptions
- The more languages "FABGen" will have available, the more users there will be and this will exponentially increase and may even evolve later because it is free to use so everyone is free to help the project and make suggestions.



#### Constraints
- The project being available to everyone, and free, it will be difficult to make profits
